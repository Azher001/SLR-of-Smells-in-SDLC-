## 🔎 Methodology Overview

Our systematic review followed these core steps:
1. **Database Search:** Searches conducted in IEEE Xplore and ACM Digital Library (Dec 2024).
2. **Three-Phase Filtering:**  
   - Phase 1: Title and abstract screening  
   - Phase 2: Full-text screening  
   - Phase 3: Final inclusion based on relevance to software smells in any SDLC phase  
3. **Data Extraction:** Manual extraction of smell types, causes, detection/mitigation strategies.
4. **Narrative and Thematic Synthesis:** Qualitative synthesis of key findings and gaps.
